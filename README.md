This reposotory is meant to host small recipes to perform different tasks in phylogenomics, phyloinformatics, comparative genomics.  

The idea is to compile a collection of real case analyses which I use regularly
or examples developed to provide support to the etetoolkit users. So far
the content is very limitted, but more recipes will be added soon. A general scheme on
the planned topics follows:



##Content
### Command line tools

-Tree building
 - Building gene family trees
   - [Building your first phylogeny](recipes/ete_build_basics.ipynb)
   - Running multiple workflows at once
   - Computing phylogenies using evolutionary model selection (proteins and nucleotides)
 - Bulding species trees 
   - Gene concatenation approaches
 - General tips for masive generation of trees (i.e. HPC environments, clusters, NFS disks, etc.)

- Tree comparison

- Tree visualization

### ete3 API 

- Tree rooting

- Tree visualization

- Tree comparison

- Orthology prediction

- Phylostatigraphic methods
