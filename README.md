This reposotory is meant to host small recipes to perform different tasks in phylogenomics, phyloinformatics, comparative genomics.  

The idea is to compile a collection of real case analyses which I use regularly
or that I have solved as part of the support to the etetoolkit software. So far
the content is very limitted, but more will be added soon.  A general scheme on
planned topics is bellow.

Contributions are very welcome
